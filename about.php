                    My name is Hristo Stamenov. <br />
                    I am from Bulgaria currently working as a full stack developer at <a href="http://www.indeavr.com/"><b>Indeavr</b></a> working with Microsoft's ASP.NET technologies.<br />

                    I am always motivated to learn and do things by myself which makes me a good researcher. I am good at R&amp;Ds and exploring new paths of action. All these parts of my character make me do and work with all kinds of techonlogies on the computer and in my life. I have worked all kinds of jobs from mail deliverer trough construction worker and system administrator to a programmer. I am a big fan of DIY which this blog is all about - made in vanilla PHP just to learn the language and how things are made the hard way.
